                        If you purchase any of our paid Services, you agree to pay us the applicable fees and taxes. Failure to pay these fees may result in the termination of your subscription. Also:
                        <ul style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
                            <li>Your purchase may be subject to foreign exchange fees or differences in prices based on location (e.g. exchange rates).</li>
                            <li>You authorize us to store and continue billing your payment method (e.g. credit card) even after it has expired, to avoid interruptions in your service (e.g. subscriptions) and to facilitate easy payment for new services.</li>

                    <b>MINIMIZING CREDIT CARD FRAUD</b>
                    <p>Jobs In ABA is committed to minimizing fraudulent credit card transactions. We have implemented a system of internal controls and verification to confirm the validity of credit card transactions.</p>
                    <p>
                        Jobs In ABA takes credit card information seriously:<br />
                        All compute data is encrypted per current banking standards, and NO complete credit card information is ever stored in any of our computer systems. We can only access the last four digits of any credit card stored in our computer systems. Any retained paperwork and ‘orders in process’ containing credit card information are kept in locked file cabinets until discarded. ANY discarded paperwork containing credit card information is shredded. We are subject to compliance with the credit card operation policies of our accepted credit cards – Visa, MasterCard, Discover and American Express card authorization for monthly and yearly recurring billing is obtained and confirmed at the time of subscription.
